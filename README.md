# Bristol Nightlife

This is most of the code to my Bristol Nightlife app for windows phone.

This app is my first foray into phone development, the lack  of tests is due to the speed in trying to make things work and also the fact that there's not that much testable logic. 

The app calls to a webservice and displays the data, with a tiny bit of in memory caching for speediness. I don't want to show details of the exact web service so have left a fake url there.

Windows phone's browser is a bit weird, it flashes white when created which is annoying. Have implemented a hack-y solution that was found in a forum of which I've forgotten.

Enjoy.
